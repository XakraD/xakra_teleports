# xakra_teleports
## Requirements
- vorp_core
- vorp_character

## Description:
The original script is from RicX, the name of the script is "ricx_inside". This script allows you to create entry and exit teleports to interiors without a door, filtering who has access based on job.

## Updates:
- Blips have been enabled (previous script had no code for blips).
- Floor markings have been modified.
- Now only 2 enter and exit coordinates are needed (previously 2 enter and 2 exit).
- Event in VORP when not having access due to job.
- All texts have been added in the config.

## Instructions to incorporate script:
- Copy the script into a folder (to choose) from the 'resources' folder.
- Add 'ensure xakra_teleports' in the 'Resources.cfg' document
- Check the config.lua file and configure your teleport points.
